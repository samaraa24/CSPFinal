Student groups will create a comprehensive interactive data analysis and modeling
platform that enables users to seamlessly import, clean, visualize, analyze, and model data
using scientific calculations and data visualization tools.
The platform will tackle the problem of voice intelligibility in enclosed spaces that can be
disruptive to hearing and learning. Large enclosed spaces, if not properly treated, may
induce long reverberation times
